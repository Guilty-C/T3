NOTE: Frontier degenerated to 1 point. This implies one algorithm dominates all others (or oracle dominates).
Dominance Explanation: raucb_plus has mean_swer=0.0000 (lowest) AND mean_mos=5.0000 (highest) among all candidates in this window.

Caption-A: Physical Consistency check passed (monotonic SNR-sWER relationship). The sWER decreases as SNR increases, confirming the channel model behavior. (bins_snr=25, environment-level binning, ensemble-average across algorithms x seeds; see fig02_physics_log.txt: monotonic=True, viol_points=[])
Caption-B: Selection density analysis (window_frac=0.2, window_start_step=8000). RA-UCB++ geometry metrics: ridge_density=0.229, entropy=1.793, top5pct_mass=1.000, effective_support=5.303, support_frac=0.009, n_inrange_total=2000.
Caption-C: Algorithm-level Pareto analysis (x=mean_sWER, y=mean_MOS) using semantic_weight. algo_level_frontier_points=1, frontier_algos=['raucb_plus']. Conclusion: raucb_plus has mean_swer=0.0000 (lowest) AND mean_mos=5.0000 (highest) among all candidates in this window.
