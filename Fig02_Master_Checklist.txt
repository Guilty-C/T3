Fig.02 — Master Checklist (Design Version)

Purpose:
This checklist defines the mandatory steps and sanity checks required to generate Fig.02.
Any unchecked item means Fig.02 is NOT ready to be plotted.

==================================================
0. Task Boundary Definition
==================================================
[ ] Fig.02 goal stated in ONE sentence:
    "Demonstrate that RA-UCB++ learns a physically-consistent, semantic-aware,
     and constraint-feasible decision structure in joint (P,B,s_t) space."
[ ] Fig.02 does NOT discuss regret or log(T).
[ ] Fig.02 focuses on time-average / distributions / geometry.
[ ] No new algorithms or learning rules are introduced.

==================================================
1. Environment & Data Protocol (Hard Freeze)
==================================================
1.1 Environment parameters (must be consistent with Fig.01)
[ ] Scenario fixed (stationary or specified non-stationary).
[ ] SNR range fixed (e.g., 0–20 dB).
[ ] Noise / interference level fixed (medium or heavy).
[ ] Power space: P_t in [20,33] dBm, step size fixed.
[ ] Bandwidth space: B_t in [5,20] kHz, total bandwidth constraint fixed.
[ ] Semantic weight s_t distribution fixed (Beta or two-point).
[ ] No modification of distributions inside Fig.02.

1.2 Data source consistency
[ ] All figures are generated ONLY from run_experiments CSV outputs.
[ ] No recomputation of QoE / PER / sWER inside plotting scripts.
[ ] Each figure traceable to:
    - CSV filename
    - seed
    - horizon
    - scenario

==================================================
2. Algorithm Set & Roles
==================================================
[ ] RA-UCB++: main subject.
[ ] SafeOpt-GP: strong safety continuous baseline.
[ ] Safe-LinUCB: linear contextual baseline.
[ ] SW-UCB: fixed-grid / non-stationary baseline.
[ ] Lagrangian-PPO: RL-based baseline.

Rules:
[ ] Not every figure must include all algorithms.
[ ] Each figure explicitly states: "RA-UCB++ vs which baseline?"

==================================================
3. Figure Group Design (Story-Driven)
==================================================
3.1 Physical-layer sanity
[ ] SNR–PER or SNR–sWER curves.
[ ] Monotonicity verified.
[ ] Optional bandwidth-conditioned PER bands.
[ ] Explicitly stated as environment sanity, not learning gain.

3.2 Action selection geometry (CORE)
[ ] (P,B) selection heatmap.
[ ] Time window defined (e.g., last 20% of horizon).
[ ] Normalization method specified.
[ ] RA-UCB++ shows concentrated ridge / zooming.
[ ] Baselines show grid-like or scattered patterns.
[ ] No mixing of raw points across seeds without clarification.

3.3 Semantic & constraint response
[ ] QoE vs semantic weight s_t (segmented or box plot).
[ ] QoE vs semantic threshold D_bar.
[ ] QoE–sWER Pareto frontier.
[ ] RA-UCB++ shows stronger gain at high s_t.
[ ] QoE increases smoothly when constraints are relaxed.

==================================================
4. Statistics & Reproducibility
==================================================
[ ] Multi-seed averaging applied.
[ ] Error bars or confidence regions defined consistently.
[ ] Time-average vs ensemble-average clearly stated.
[ ] No cherry-picked seeds or runs.

==================================================
5. Caption & Explanation Check
==================================================
[ ] Each figure has one functional explanation sentence.
    BAD: "Performance is better."
    GOOD: "RA-UCB++ concentrates decisions along the feasible ridge,
          indicating effective zooming."
[ ] Each observed phenomenon attributed to:
    - physical model
    - learning mechanism
    - semantic weighting

==================================================
6. Hard Stop (Any violation => STOP)
==================================================
[ ] Figures are visually appealing but theoretically empty.
[ ] Fig.02 conclusions do not logically connect to Fig.01.
[ ] Cannot answer "why" beyond "because experiments show so."

==================================================
7. Completion Criterion
==================================================
Fig.02 is complete ONLY IF:
The advisor can infer algorithm behavior directly from the figures,
without reading the code.
