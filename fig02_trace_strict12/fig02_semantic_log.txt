NOTE: Frontier degenerated to 1 point. This implies one algorithm dominates all others (or oracle dominates).
Dominance Explanation: raucb_plus has mean_swer=0.2839 (lowest) AND mean_mos=3.5807 (highest) among all candidates in this window.

Caption-A: Physical Consistency check passed (monotonic SNR-sWER relationship). The sWER decreases as SNR increases, confirming the channel model behavior.
Caption-B: Selection density analysis (window=0.2). RA-UCB++ shows focused selection (ridge_density=0.173, support_frac=0.056), indicating convergence to specific (P,B) regions.
Caption-C: Algorithm-level Pareto analysis (x=mean_sWER, y=mean_MOS) using q_semantic (proxy for semantic load). Dominance Explanation: raucb_plus has mean_swer=0.2839 (lowest) AND mean_mos=3.5807 (highest) among all candidates in this window.
